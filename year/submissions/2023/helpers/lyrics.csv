lyrics
I met a man
He was a good man
Sailing and shoring
Dancing the beta can-can
Making me foreign
I want to live in Los Angeles
Not the one in Los Angeles
"No, not the one in South California"
They got one in South Patagonia
They got a bunch down in Moleville
They got a bunch more still
They got one in twenty-five two five
Works just like a beehive
Counting helicopters on Saturday night
The symphony of the fair light
I hear them saying Los Angeles
In all the black and white movies
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
"My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody"""
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
"Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires"
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
"No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins"
Every day like the first day
So I love him even more on his worst day
"And I don't know why, he don't ever give up"
"But everytime he does, I'm right back at it"
You gotta give yourself some credit
Girls like you make the world go round
You make the world go round and round
Guess that's why I love him
"I can't lie, I love him"
Now the tide is rolling in
I don't wanna win
"Let it take me, let it take me"
I'll be on my way
How long can I stay?
In a place that can't contain me
Please don't say you need me
"Release me, believе me"
One day you will see me
"Bеlieve me, believe me"
I'm still a fan even though I was salty
"Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy"
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
"I'm so mature, I'm so mature"
"I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men"
"I don't want none, I just want you"
"If I can't have you, no one should, I might"
"I might kill my ex, not the best idea"
"His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?"
"I might kill my ex, I still love him, though"
Rather be in jail than alone
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
"The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence"
"I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion"
"But, damn, you was out of reach"
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
"Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience"
"Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat"
I did it all for love
I did it all on no drugs
I did all of this sober
"I did it all for us, oh"
I did it all for love
I did all of this on no drugs
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us?
