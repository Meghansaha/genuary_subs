The texts read And I don't know why, he don't ever give up ,  Please don't say you need me ,  I might kill my ex, I still love him though... ,  Not eh one in Los Angeles ,  the text gon' be evidence... this text is evidence... grimace emoji ,  I did it all on no drugs  The iPhone is in dark mode, it's screen is cracked, and the current time is 9:11." fig-align="center"}
